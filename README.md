An interactive web application that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the sinking of the Titanic. This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data exploration and model training to deployment as a user-friendly web app.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Interactive UI:** A clean and intuitive interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input passenger details easily via a sidebar.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Leverages a trained Logistic Regression model to provide instant survival predictions.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** The model is trained on the official Kaggle Titanic dataset, capturing real historical patterns and correlations.
- **Detailed & Visual Results:** Displays not just the final verdict (Survived/Not Survived) but also the prediction probability, enhanced with progress bars and celebratory (or commiseratory) GIFs.
- **Reproducible Workflow:** The entire process is scripted and documented, ensuring that the model can be retrained and the results reproduced reliably.

    git clone https://github.com/[your-github-username]/Titanic-Survival-Predictor.git
    cd Titanic-Survival-Predictor
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # For macOS/Linux

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run the Project

### 1. Model Training (Optional)

The repository includes a pre-trained model. However, if you wish to retrain it, you can run the training script. This will process the data from `data/train.csv` and save a new model file to `models/titanic_model.joblib`.

```bash
python src/train.py
